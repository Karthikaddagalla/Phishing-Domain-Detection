# Phishing Domain Detection


These project is used to detect whether the given link is phishing or not. It is the second version of the already built model with more clean UI and improved accuracy.

**What is Phishing** 

Phishing is an type of attack in which an attacker sends a link to the victim and when victim clicks on that link and enters his personal information, 
the attacker gets access to that information. 

**How it Works:** 
```
> User enters a link in the website

> The link will be sent to the django backend

> Seven pre-trained Machine learning algorithms(Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines ,
  K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier Gradient Boosting Classifier and
  Multi Layer Perceptron) will be used to predict whether the given link is phishing or not.
  
> Based on voting algorithm(majority vote) we will find whether the link is phishing or not.   

> Based on output from ML algorithms, we will print whether given link is phishing or not in the website

```

**Tech Stack Used:** Django, HTML, CSS, Machine Learning.
