# Phishing_Domain_Detection


These project which is called phishing domain detection is used to detect whether the given link is phishing or not. 

Technologies Used = Django, HTML, CSS, Machine Learning.

These was deployed on the heroku and you can visit that website by going to "https://thephish.herokuapp.com/"

**How it Works:** 
```
> User enters a link in the website
> The link will be sent to the django backend
> Seven pre trained Machine learning algorithms(Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines , K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier 
    Gradient Boosting Classifier and Multi Layer Perceptron) will predict whether the given link is phishing or not. Based on voting algorithm(majority vote) we will
    find whether the link is phishing or not.   
> Based on output from ML algorithms, we will print whether given link is phising or not in the website

```
